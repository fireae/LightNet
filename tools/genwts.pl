Usage: $0 -t TYPE -o OUTFILE INFILE(s)

Convert the input text file INFILEs containing weight numbers to one text file
OUTFILE in hexadecimal string format.

A OUTFILE starts with a line of an integer for the number of weight arrays in
this file. Each weight array is represented in a line, which has the following
fields seperated in spaces: a weight name in C identifier syntax, an integer
for the data type, an integer for the length of the array, and an array of
hexadecimal words of the machine storage format of the weights.

The weight name will be the initial part conforming to C identifier syntax
of the file name of a INFILE. The integer for the data type allows 0 (float),
1 (half), 2 (int8), set with the `type` option (currently it only supports 0
and 2). The integer for the length of the array will be the number of weight
numbers in a INFILE. Weights are literal floating or integer constant strings
seperated by white spaces and some punctuations.
